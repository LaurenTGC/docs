## Ribut.us Community

I consider Ribut.us to be like a public park. It can only exist if everyone
using it chips in and helps protect it's integrity. Public parks provide a place
free of commerce. This isn't because commerce is bad, simply that there should
be some places beyond it's reach. Ribut.us is one of those places. Users
attempting to commercialize Ribut.us are not welcome.
