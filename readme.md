## Ribut
The Ribut framework will be a set of protocols and services for building
distributed applicaitons.

Ribut will be
* Easy to use
* Fast
* Secure
* Private
* Decentralized

### Why
I started with the (hardly unique) goal of building a social networking
platform that would not sell private information to advertisers and engage in
aggressive advertising practices. I am already unhappy with the state of the
industry and the trajectory indicates that it will only get worse.

I've spent years picking apart the problem and I believe the answer is a fully
distributed and decentralized that uses mix-net routing and encryption.

### Easy to use
It is crucial that Ribut be easy to use. And that includes all aspects of
security. Setup should be a simple download and install. All extensions should
be installed through Ribut and validated as well. Ribut will update itself
silently.

### Fast
Ribut has a much higher overhead than the Web. Encryption, onion routing and
distributed systems all add overhead. But the Web today transmits large amounts
of information for tracking and advertising that has no value to the user. Our
goal is to keep the system overhead below the advertising overhead.

### Secure
Ribut is secure by default. All source code is open, leaving fewer places for
malicious code and exploits to hide. Local data is encrypted on disk. Ribut
applications are binaries signed not just by the author, but by many members of
the community.

### Private
Ribut is private. Users have precise control over what is shared. No personally
identifiable information should every be required to use any part of the system.
Any communication that could possibly contain personal information is passed
through a mix-net.

### Decentralized
The system is fully distributed and decentralized. The goal is to maintain a
system where underining either the security or privacy would require underning
the majority of the network.
